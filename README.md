# React_Native_Dev_Containter
Repo containing a Dockerfile for a container dedicated to making React-Native apps. As the Dockerfile and container are developed, this will be changed to reflect those changes

Basically, the intent of this is to create an easy to use environment for react-native app development. I'm tired of waffling on learning docker and react-native and this project will push me a bit closer to learning both!
